# Java Mad Libs Console Game

This is a simple **Mad Libs** game written in Java.  
It asks the user for a few words (like adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.) and then prints a funny story in the console using those inputs.

## Purpose of this Repository

The main goal of this repository is **not** to show a unique or heavily modified project.  
This code is based on the Mad Libs project from the **Bro Code** Java course on YouTube, and was recreated for practice.

The primary purpose is to:

- Learn how to use **Git** and **GitHub** (creating repos, committing, pushing).
- Practice basic Java project structure in an IDE (IntelliJ).
- Get comfortable uploading even small beginner projects to a portfolio.

## What the Program Does

- Prompts the user for several words (e.g., adjectives, nouns, verbs).
- Inserts those words into a pre-written story.
- Outputs the final story in the console.

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
- IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition or similar)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<Autzm>/<java-madlibs-console>.git
